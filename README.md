# Introduction
#### Hi! My name is Abby and I'm a 10th grader at Chatsworth Charter High School. I'm also on the volleyball team! 

## Summer Activities:
Over the summer, I spent a lot of time with my family. We went on a cruise trip around Europe. This was my first cruise ever and it was so much fun! It was a fun experience to meet new people and explore new countries. My family and I went to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, France, and a few more countries. I had a lot of fun exploring the countries and the views were beautiful. I also spent a lot of time hanging out with my friends. We went swimming and shopped at the mall! Besides spending time with my family and friends, I spent half the summer at school to practice for the upcoming volleyball season. I'm super excited, but I'm already tired! 

## Goals for the School Year:
I'm super excited for this school year to begin. My goals for this school year is to pay close attention in class to actually understand what my teachers are expecting from me. I'm looking forward to have a complete understanding of all the concepts I'll be taught in class. I want to actively engage in class and collaborate with my peers to make this school year as easy as possible. Another goal I have for this year is to get good grades in all of my classes. However, I'm looking forward to having fun, too!

## Favorite Summer Memory with Friends:
My favorite summer memory with my friends was when they came over to my house and we spent the day at the pool. We had a blast jumping and swimming in the pool. After a day at the pool, we went to the Vineyards to have dinner and walk around to relax for the night. We grabbed Chipotle and ice cream for a sweet treat after. After finishing our meal, we walked around and chilled. We went into Ulta to buy some things before we all went back to my house. This was my favorite summer memory because I hadn't seen my friends since school ended and it was nice to spend the day with people that always know how to make me laugh and put a smile on my face. 

## Learning Experiences:
Besides spending my summer with my family and friends, I spent a lot of days at home doing my summer classes. I had to take Spanish II A over the summer so I wouldn't have to take it during the school year. Although it was stressful, I'm glad I took the class over the summer to get it over with. I wasn't able to start Spanish II B over the usmmer, but I will be able to take the class online this semester. Taking a Spanish class gives me an advantage to be able to communicate with Spanish speakers. Being able to speak Spanish and taking the class also enhances your resume which is a great advantage when looking for jobs.

## Future Aspirations:
My future aspirations in life is to obviously graduate high school. After graduating, I want to go to a good college that offers a medical program. I'm interested in working in the medical field and becoming a pediatric nurse. I want to become a pediatric nurse because I believe I would have a good connections with kids and thier parents. I want to be able to help them through whatever they're going through and be a safe place for them. When I finish college, I would want to continue my education at a medical school that can help me achieve this big goal. I'm excited for what my future brings me and I'm going to work very hard until I reach my goal.
